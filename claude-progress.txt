### 2. Init Script (init.sh)
Created comprehensive setup script that:
- Detects Raspberry Pi 5 vs development environment
- Creates Python virtual environment
- Installs all required dependencies (with proper quoting for pip)
- Creates project directory structure
- Initializes SQLite databases with schemas
- Creates default configuration
- Sets up model placeholders

### 3. Git Repository
- Initialized Git repository on `main` branch
- Created .gitignore for Python, models, user data, IDE files
- Made initial commit with all project files (31 files, 3836 lines)

### 4. Project Structure
Created full directory hierarchy per app_spec.txt:
```
personas/survival/
├── medical/
├── vision/
├── navigation/
├── survival/
├── emergency/
├── voice/
├── ui/
├── sensors/
├── data/{regional,maps}/
└── models/

config/
tests/{unit,integration,safety}/
assets/{sounds,images}/
logs/
```

### 5. Configuration
Created config/survival_config.yaml with:
- System settings (persona name, version)
- Memory management (max 7.5GB RAM)
- Voice interface (wake words, STT/TTS config)
- LLM settings (Phi-3 + BioMistral)
- Medical safety layer (forbidden patterns, disclaimers)
- Hardware configuration (all sensors, GPIO pins)
- Power management (timeouts, battery thresholds)
- Vision models (Hailo HEF files)
- Database paths

### 6. Documentation
- README.md with quick start, architecture, safety info
- Model placeholder files with download instructions

### 7. Sample Tests
Created tests/test_sample.py with:
- Project structure validation
- Safety layer pattern matching tests
- Configuration validation tests
