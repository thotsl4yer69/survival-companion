Total: 260 features (exceeds 205 target by 55)

### 2. Init Script (init.sh)
Created comprehensive setup script that:
- Detects Raspberry Pi 5 vs development environment
- Creates Python virtual environment
- Installs all required dependencies (with proper quoting for pip)
- Creates project directory structure
- Initializes SQLite databases with schemas
- Creates default configuration
- Sets up model placeholders

### 3. Git Repository
- Initialized Git repository on `main` branch
- Created .gitignore for Python, models, user data, IDE files
- Made initial commit with all project files (31 files, 3836 lines)

### 4. Project Structure
Created full directory hierarchy per app_spec.txt:
```
personas/survival/
├── medical/
├── vision/
├── navigation/
├── survival/
├── emergency/
├── voice/
├── ui/
├── sensors/
├── data/{regional,maps}/
└── models/

config/
tests/{unit,integration,safety}/
assets/{sounds,images}/
logs/
```

### 5. Configuration
Created config/survival_config.yaml with:
- System settings (persona name, version)
- Memory management (max 7.5GB RAM)
- Voice interface (wake words, STT/TTS config)
- LLM settings (Phi-3 + BioMistral)
- Medical safety layer (forbidden patterns, disclaimers)
- Hardware configuration (all sensors, GPIO pins)
- Power management (timeouts, battery thresholds)
- Vision models (Hailo HEF files)
- Database paths

### 6. Documentation
- README.md with quick start, architecture, safety info
- Model placeholder files with download instructions

### 7. Sample Tests
Created tests/test_sample.py with:
- Project structure validation
- Safety layer pattern matching tests
- Configuration validation tests

# Session 2 Progress Report
# ================================================
# Coding Agent - Session in Progress
# Date: 2026-01-07

## Summary
Continued implementation of core navigation features. Implemented GPS position
tracking with real-time updates, waypoint marking with persistence, and
distance/bearing calculation for waypoint navigation.

## Features Completed This Session

### Feature #16: GPS position tracking (PASSING)
- Added real-time GPS polling (1-second intervals) on navigation page
- GPS coordinates update automatically with simulated drift
- Added accuracy indicator display (high/medium/low based on accuracy value)
- Added accuracy badge in UI
- Compass heading updates from GPS data
- All 6 test steps verified and passing

### Feature #18: Waypoint marking (PASSING)
- Implemented complete Waypoint CRUD API (`/api/waypoints`)
- Waypoints persisted to JSON file (`data/waypoints.json`)
- Added waypoint dialog UI with name, category, and notes fields
- Waypoints survive server restarts (persistence verified)
- Added waypoint list display in navigation page
- All 6 test steps verified and passing

### Feature #19: Distance and bearing to waypoint (PASSING)
- Implemented Haversine formula for distance calculation
- Implemented bearing calculation with compass direction conversion
- Added navigation target state management
- Navigation panel UI shows distance, bearing, direction
- Arrow rotation indicates direction to turn
- Distance decreases when moving toward waypoint (verified)
- All 7 test steps verified and passing

### Feature #17: Offline map rendering (SKIPPED)
- Requires MBTiles integration and map rendering library
- Moved to end of priority queue for later implementation

## Current Status
- **Features Passing: 18/260 (6.9%)**

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Added Waypoint and Navigation APIs
- `templates/navigation.html` - Added GPS polling, waypoints list, navigation UI

## Next Steps for Next Session
1. Continue with next feature from `feature_get_next`
2. Consider implementing breadcrumb trails feature
3. Work on more functional features

## Environment State
- Node.js server running on port 5000
- GPS tracking active with position updates
- Waypoints data stored in `data/waypoints.json`
- Features database: 18/260 passing
